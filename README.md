## Overview
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Early detection can help in taking preventive measures and treatment to reduce the risk. This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient based on various medical attributes using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle and contains several medical predictors such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar, and more.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. Additionally, install the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
    cd heart-disease-prediction
    ```
2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook heart_disease_prediction.ipynb
    ```
4. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Model
The notebook covers the following steps:
1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset and visualizing the features.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data and preparing it for the model.
3. **Model Training**: Training various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and others.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated, and the best-performing model is selected based on the evaluation metrics. Details of the results can be found in the notebook.
